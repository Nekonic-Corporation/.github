- **WTFAQ** is our documentation site for companies that really suck at writing documentation,
- **Artemis Linux** is our security first Linux Operating System,
- **LBQO** (Little Buddy Quebo) is our Load Balancing Queue Offset: takes requests from clients demanding resources that should be sent to them based on it's severity of operation score. An image such as a banner would be a low score, whereas scripts that need to be loaded first like billing are right at the top.
- **Nekonic DSEQ** Our really complicated network security algorithm and security control.
- **JADE** The from the ground up Artificial Technology stack designed for fast operation on low end systems first before high end.
- **Nekonic Messenger** The complicated messaging platform that allows our employees and customers to communicate in realtime, instead of utilizing 3rd party insecure communication it's all security focused.
- **Nekonic Hosting** Running a complete Virtual Machine and Networking control center to ensure you only get the best of the best, no more will you need to be worried about someone snooping your data.
- **FuryOS** Fast, non POSIX Operating System designed with security first, questions later. It's what holds our services to a high standard.
- **Apollo Repo** Our Apollo Repo is used for sharing packages to our customers using Artemis Linux, this also has support for Debian and RPM packages so there is no more disconnect of what packages developers throw out there.
- **Manwich Packages Authority** FuryOS also has a package manager specifically designed for it's own programming language support as Linux, Windows packages (Without the compatibility layer would be useless)

# What are these Repos for?

All the public repos (We have our own source control locally for our proprietary systems) is when a software is deemed unsatisfactory for monetary purposes. When a software is deemed this way then we publish them for the public to use under a strict credit us if used. It means that although open source we expect our name to be placed on the product name or publically shown somewhere in a way that it's impossible to miss to ensure you won't rip us off.<br>
#### Our software is held under a custom license that enforces this which is bound to our Terms of Use and Source Access Policy located in each repository, each document, each source file and binaries.
